The last couple weeks have been very interesting with a rash of announcements that have cable-cutters chomping at the bit.  From HBO Now to Sling TV, it is getting easier to toss cable companies by the wayside and watch what you want.  In fact, recently TiVo purchased Aereo's assets which caused me to ponder why Aereo didn't make it and what might have saved it.

Months ago, the Supreme Court handed down the judgement that Aereo was violating copyright law and would be unable to continue their business in its current form. This is disappointing not just for cable cutters, but also for broadcast networks. Aereo missed a golden opportunity to change the way we consume television and how broadcast networks do business.

For the uninitiated, Aereo made broadcast television available online to people without a cable subscription [(via marketplace.org)](http://www.marketplace.org).  They did this by renting a micro antenna to a user for about $10/month. The user accessed their antenna online via web or mobile apps. Aereo also provided a DVR for users so they could normally record content. Broadcasters (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox) weren't fans of this because it was a channel for their content they had no control over nor were they being paid.  These companies make money from their advertisements and also fees paid to them by companies like Comcast.  The DVR feature allowed users to skip over the ads and since the signal was received over the air, no fees were paid.  Two main revenue streams gone for Aereo users.

More and more people are walking away from television because of high subscription fees and an inability to unbundle channels.  Looking at Mary Meekerâ€™s deck on 2014 Internet Trends, time spent watching TV is declining. However ad spend, which already counts for nearly 50% of advertising, is increasing.

Ultimately, this creates a disconnect between where ad money is going and who it is getting spent on. This money will flow where it provides the greatest return as no advertiser wants to talk about their product to an empty room (to be fair, television is hardly an empty room but disruption brought on by the internet happens fast).  Unless networks are able to demonstrate high ROI, advertisers will begin to look to other spots to market to customers.

Unfortunately, shutting down the service was shortsighted on both Aereo and the Networks parts.  Really, Aereo should have been a data business all along.  Aereo's setup had individual radio antennas for each user which offered the ability to understand which households are watching what shows on a granular level not offered anywhere else.  This provides more accurate viewership numbers for shows and better identify demographics of an audience.  The real benefit is that it can be used to connect advertisements to real sales.  This would have given broadcasters a chance to do what has always been hazy at best: prove an ROI for television ads.  Too bad Aereo didn't take this approach from the beginning.
