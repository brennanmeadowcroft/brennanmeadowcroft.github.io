One of the benefits of software is that it can simplify complex, structured tasks into interfaces that are simple and guide the user to completion.  Rather than requiring a user to understand all the ins and outs of a process, the computer can get a few inputs and obscure it.  My girlfriend is taking a tax class and one of her assignments is to create a tax return from scratch for some fake husband and wife.  The potential for tax fraud aside, I was shocked the number of forms required.

Tax law is incredibly complex and is only getting worse.  Now, the IRS is probably not adding elements to deliberately make filing a tax return more complex (or are they?) but they are guilty of adding items without rethinking existing processes.  Software such as TurboTax have been able to pick up the slack and obscure an increasing number of forms, they have been able to just add to the complexity; one more field, one more form.

No one seems to be asking the question: is the new form the best way of handling this?

The IRS is not the only culprit.  Businesses do this everyday.  Rather than stopping to think about the overall goal of the application and how this addition fits into it, an extra step in a process or piece of information can be added to the software.  This breeds laziness since we can rely on the front end.  Why ask the question about whether something is truly useful or could be handled a different way when it is simple to add another field?  What ends up happening is layering in an application… progressive additions without periodic refactoring leads to overly complicated processes that become tough to untangle.

That is not to say that every addition requires rethinking your whole approach.  Sometimes, adding a field is the easiest and best.  I’m advocating for keeping an open mind.  Ask whether this field is temporary and how it fits into the overall strategy.
