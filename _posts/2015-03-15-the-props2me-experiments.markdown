I particpated in my first official Hackathon a couple weeks ago, Hack The Dot, where the challenge was to take a given domain name and build a service or website to fit the theme of the domain... all in about two hours.  The domain was croissant.forsale.  Ultimately, we created a site with a talking croissant that would spit out random statements as it tried to sell you on itself.  The croissant was a little snooty and I spent most of the time designing the croissant and not much time with the actual coding.  Not programming was not my first choice but it wasn't a big deall; my graphic design skills were unique among the rest of the group and it was something that we needed so I obliged.  My main goal of the hackathon was to meet people and maybe learn something new anyway.

I've always struggled with feeling inadequete when it comes to programming knowledge and interacting with new people.  Usually this goes away after some conversation and this event was no exception.  While we didn't work with technology I have a lot of experience with, I was able to get some exposure to some new things, namely NodeJS and Express.  What was probably the most frustrating is that I was unable to contribute directly.  If we had more time, I could have jumped in and figured it out but, in two hours, that didn't really work.  That experience made me think, "I need to actively keep abreast of new changes in web development and test out new things".

Thus, I've decided to launch "The Props2Me Experiments".  Props2Me was an application I built about a year ago to help people get feedback from their peers.  While the application didn't go anywhere (Datalogix launched an HR program that had a similar function about a week before we were going to test this among my team), it proved to be an immense learning experience around AngularJS and RESTful services.  So now, once again, I turn to Props2Me as a learning tool.

With it's easy to uncomplicated structure, it is similar to a todo app but something created entirely by me so I have a little more investment in it.  My goal with the Props2Me Experiments is to recreate the application using new technology and languages that I have never used.  This way, I have a common application that I know backwards and forwards which allows me to focus on the new tech, make comparisons and let me actually form an opinion.

On the list so far is NodeJS & Express, React and Flask.  New ones will be added as they come up and thoughts about each will be posted here.
